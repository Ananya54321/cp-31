Call an array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
 sorted if 𝑎1≤𝑎2≤…≤𝑎𝑛−1≤𝑎𝑛
.

Ntarsis has an array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
.

He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times):

Choose an index 𝑖
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛−1
).
Add 1
 to 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑖
.
Subtract 1
 from 𝑎𝑖+1,𝑎𝑖+2,…,𝑎𝑛
.
The values of 𝑎
 can be negative after an operation.

Determine the minimum operations needed to make 𝑎
 not sorted.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤100
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛
 (2≤𝑛≤500
) — the length of the array 𝑎
.

The next line contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (1≤��𝑖≤109
) — the values of array 𝑎
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛
 across all test cases does not exceed 500
.

Output
Output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array not sorted.
