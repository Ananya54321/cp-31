You are given an integer 𝑛
, which you want to obtain. You have an unlimited supply of every integer from 1
 to 𝑘
, except integer 𝑥
 (there are no integer 𝑥
 at all).

You are allowed to take an arbitrary amount of each of these integers (possibly, zero). Can you make the sum of taken integers equal to 𝑛
?

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤100
) — the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains three integers 𝑛,𝑘
 and 𝑥
 (1≤𝑥≤𝑘≤𝑛≤100
).

Output
For each test case, in the first line, print "YES" or "NO" — whether you can take an arbitrary amount of each integer from 1
 to 𝑘
, except integer 𝑥
, so that their sum is equal to 𝑛
.

If you can, the second line should contain a single integer 𝑚
 — the total amount of taken integers. The third line should contain 𝑚
 integers — each of them from 1
 to 𝑘
, not equal to 𝑥
, and their sum is 𝑛
.
