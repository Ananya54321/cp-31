A. Array Coloring
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an array consisting of 𝑛
 integers. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to color all its elements in two colors in such a way that the sums of the elements of both colors have the same parity and each color has at least one element colored.

For example, if the array is [1,2,4,3,2,3,5,4
], we can color it as follows: [1,2,4,3,2,3,5,4
], where the sum of the blue elements is 6
 and the sum of the red elements is 18
.

Input
The first line contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤1000
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case begins with a line containing an integer 𝑛
 (2≤𝑛≤50
) — the length of the array 𝑎
.

The next line contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤50
) — the elements of the array 𝑎
.

Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to color the array in two colors in such a way that the sums of the elements of both colors have the same parity and each color has at least one element colored, and "NO" otherwise.
